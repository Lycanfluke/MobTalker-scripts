Snow Golem:
The player wil start out in a playful relationship (friends) but will take it up a notch later, however not as fast as Pentigan's Blaze script.

Iron Golem:
The Iron Golem will act a bit shy and will be demanding, but the Iron Golem will assist the player in fighting. Since Golems now spawn in villages naturally, most of the script will be about the village.

The Spider Sisters:
The normal Spider will probably be playful and joyous. The Cave Spider will be energetic but will be taught some manners by the player.

Partially Liquids/Solids:
The player will somewhat compliment them or be rude, depending on the path you choose. Complimenting will lead to 18+ on day 7 or 8.

The Creeper:
Since the Creeper is a teen, she will be curious and will not get married to the player by day 7, but will still enter somewhat a 18+ section. It's safe for maybe 16+, as it will not quite talk about procreating.

Mobs that can't become friendly:
They will be kind to the player, exept for one thing... BIRD OF PREY!!! *Peck*
